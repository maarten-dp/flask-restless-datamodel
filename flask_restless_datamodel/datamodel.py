    This is the actual point where we catch the relevant configuration made

    exclude columns, but as needs may arise in the future this method may
    grow.

    Flask-Restless generates APIView classes on the fly for each registered model
    and uses this class as a view_func. We monkey patch the call to get access
    to the parameters and then return it back to the original method.
    Due to Flask's "as_view" implementation, it is the only entry point to
    retrieve this information without restrictions. There are other ways to
    retrieve it, but it relies on import and initialisation order, and quickly
    becomes dirty and restrictive.

    And this way, we're at least dropping the restrictive part :)
